2D Side-scrolling web page  game developed with Phaser

Introduction:

This game was created according to many examples of ACT type, such as Metal Slug series. To produce a fantastic effect, I used many sprite sheets to produce animations, and embedded some audio clips to make players feel more excited while playing. The enemies in this game cannot move at all, they are stuck where they are first generated, but they can shoot players. The bullets are generated and can move at a lower speed when the sprite fires, so that players can see the trace of bullets.

All the artistic resources in this game are collected from the Internet. The main artistic work we do is to make animations using these resources, in addition, we make some snow falling effects on the background.

The players and enemies attack each other through bullets and other abilities. The bullet will cause larger damage on target. The players need to try their best to move to avoid being shot by enemyâ€™s bullets, such as jump or crouch. Of course it needs some skills to get proficient in.
